NoteKeeper project

A full-stack application that contains a front-end, back-end, and a database to create, delete, and persist notes using a cloud database

NOTE: This project uses Firebase 9, which requires an admin sdk to perform database operations server side, learn more here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup
