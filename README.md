NoteKeeper project

A full-stack application that utilizes a front & backend framework with a database to emulate a NoteKeeper web app. The project contains CRUD operations.

NOTE: This project uses the firebase-admin module, which requires a key to operate on. The .gitignore server-side ignores this for security reasons.

Project is apart of a blog post I was assigned to do:
